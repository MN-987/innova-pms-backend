## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://github.com/MN-987/innovaDigits-PMS-Backend/assets/77201700/cc633a3e-8905-436b-888f-832aaee94042)



### What is innovaDigits-PMS ? 

At first, let's understand what PMS is. PMS is the abbreviation for Performance Management System, which is used to align employees' individual goals and performance with the overall objectives of the company.

It encompasses processes, tools, and activities aimed at ensuring that employees work towards achieving the organization's strategic goals, thereby contributing to the company's success.

The backend we build is for modules that will be part of a bigger PMS that will be developed by one of the biggest software house companies in Egypt which is [innovaDigits](https://www.linkedin.com/company/innovadigits). 

You can find more info about the project from [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jdSpmqHTuhSN8UX0D9KCESG0CKYVQKGDcXFIBCZKM5I/edit).


Our Project Is divided into three core modules 
- User and teams
- Competencies
- FeedBack

#### Note:
- To use the Feedback or Competency modules, API calls need to be made in the Users and Teams modules.
- Details regarding these API calls can be found in the API Endpoints section.
